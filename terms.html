    <p>
      These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Swinglet mobile application (“App”) and any
      related services provided by Swinglet Digital Private Limited (“Swinglet”, “we”, “our”). By creating an account
      or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-lora font-semibold mt-6">2. Nature of Service</h2>
    <p>
      Swinglet is a social networking platform designed for adults exploring consensual relationship structures such as

      for the sale or purchase of sexual services.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-lora font-semibold mt-6">3. Your Account</h2>

      You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that

      purpose of operating and improving the service.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-lora font-semibold mt-6">6. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our collection and use of personal data is described in the <a href="/privacy.html" class="text-rose-300 underline">Privacy Policy</a>.
      By using the App, you consent to such collection and use. The App includes features such as screenshot protection
      to enhance privacy, but no technical measure is foolproof and you share content at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-lora font-semibold mt-6">7. Safety & Offline Interactions</h2>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users, whether online or offline. Swinglet does not

      common sense when arranging meetings or sharing personal information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-lora font-semibold mt-6">8. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind, whether express or
      implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Swinglet disclaims all warranties, including fitness for a
      particular purpose and non-infringement.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-lora font-semibold mt-6">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-lora font-semibold mt-6">10. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without notice, if we believe you have
      violated these Terms, created risk or legal exposure for us or others, or where required by law or regulation.
      You may stop using the App at any time by deleting your account.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-lora font-semibold mt-6">11. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>

    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and update the
